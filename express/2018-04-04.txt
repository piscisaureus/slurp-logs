In the set function assigned for app.set, I am curious why 'this.settings[setting] = val;' is written directly before a switch statement, which if the declared setting is one of a select few will be immediately overwritten. Why not make all others a default case in the switch statement?","date":"2018-04-04T02:20:15.801Z","type":"message"}

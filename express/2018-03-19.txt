{"nick":"hillct","message":"Good morning. I was recently reviwing this plugin https://github.com/indigojs/secdownload/blob/develop/index.js where the developer seems to be AWOL but it’s my sense that this plugin tries to do way more than it needs to, and does so using a design philospohy that’s counter to the general Express plugin architecture.

{"nick":"Sirisian|Work","message":"I'm using connect-busboy to handle file uploads. It works fine, but I need to await for something first, but if I do any await operation the busboy events no longer fire. Even something as simple as: app.post(`/`, async (req, res) => { await (async () => {})(); /* busboy code */ }); Without the await statement it works. I'm confused.","date":"2018-03-09T01:15:52.999Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"OStester","message":"So you're saying that by design, OpenShift needs a way to download my code from somewhere in order to deploy in case it needs to scale the app? I can not just push it to a pod using SCP or SFTP ?","date":"2018-03-12T02:50:32.389Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"agc93","message":"You technically *can*, yes, but that is definitely not how it's designed to work, and you will run into other problems down the road","date":"2018-03-12T02:51:12.127Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"OStester","message":"For example, use a public example Git repo to create the app, then once its running just SCP/SFTP my code each time I want to deploy a new vertion?","date":"2018-03-12T02:52:04.155Z","type":"message"}

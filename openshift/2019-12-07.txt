{"nick":"sorvin","message":"Hi. I'm running an image that had VOLUMES in its Dockerfile in openshift, and it respects those and mounts them. This is weird to me, because it allows the container to create files on the host filesystem.","date":"2019-12-07T07:53:21.552Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"sorvin","message":"so.. 1) is there a way to make okd not respect those VOLUMES lines in the Dockerfile? 2) Why is this even possible? Isn't it also a security issue? Thanks :)","date":"2019-12-07T07:53:57.998Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"kurtis","message":"Hey, I'm trying to run `oc cluster up` on my home Fedora-30 server but running into a typical timeout issue. Looking at journalctl, I see it can't access the health-check or any other endpoints of the API. I've added firewall rules I found online but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I'm not really sure how to debug it more; not a lot of experience with firewalld","date":"2019-09-28T14:31:38.004Z","type":"message"}

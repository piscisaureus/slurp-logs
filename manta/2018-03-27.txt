{"nick":"melloc","message":"I don't know anything about what your stack looks like or the internal politics involved, but if you're currently moving data around a lot, could you justify a small several node Manta stand-up that you then transfer some data into when you need to do compute?","date":"2018-03-27T05:24:30.566Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"drakan","message":"well, i find myself trying to get a sense of what the latencies are like in production deployments of Manta","date":"2018-03-27T05:25:03.343Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"melloc","message":"The answer to the latency question is going to depend a lot on the hardware used, and on how you configure things, such as how many shards you use for the database.","date":"2018-03-27T05:28:13.237Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"melloc","message":"I think that there might be several things that would get in the way of doing that today, but it's a good question for the mailing list. I haven't worked much with the jobs tier so my recall is fuzzy here, but I think that when you spawn a Manta job, you can specify an expected duration for the job.","date":"2018-03-27T05:39:26.307Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"melloc","message":"Running something stateful within the container during that duration works perfectly fine though. For example, mlogin sessions are basically a special kind of job.","date":"2018-03-27T05:42:53.622Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"melloc","message":"I think those are what we use in JPC right now. The systems we've been using for Samsung I believe are denser.","date":"2018-03-27T05:45:48.755Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"melloc","message":"I work more on the Triton side of things than Manta, so I'm unfortunately not particularly helpful here. The mailing list might be able to help more, especially about compute jobs. I can't find anything on compute job duration right now, just requesting memory/disk space.","date":"2018-03-27T05:53:25.393Z","type":"message"}

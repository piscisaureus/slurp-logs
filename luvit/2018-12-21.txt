{"nick":"xixor","message":"Howdy folks!  Just getting started with luvit, installed version 2.15 on windows just fine.  Looking into the examples, both tcp_echo_server.lua, and tcp_echo_server_raw.lua throw an exception that client does not have a close method when the client disconnects. Anyone know why that is, or if there is a workaround?  Cheers","date":"2018-12-21T01:03:45.099Z","type":"message"}

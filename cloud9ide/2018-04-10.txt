{"nick":"bucketm0use","message":"Hello, I'm trying to get a 'Dracula.tmTheme' file to convert to a stylesheet that I can import with AWS C9, is that possible? I got the c9sdk repository cloned, but running 'node ./tool/tmtheme.js Dracula tool/tmthemes/dracula.tmTheme ~/theme/' does not work (I can send the errors). I might be wasting time because I think this is meant for the 'normal c9 instance' rather than 'AWS'.","date":"2018-04-10T17:22:44.880Z","type":"message"}

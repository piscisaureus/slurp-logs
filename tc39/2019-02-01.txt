{"nick":"annevk","message":"littledan: I haven't looked at this in a while, but I guess a subclass doesn't get access to private state of the parent?","date":"2019-02-01T11:00:50.274Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"annevk","message":"littledan: somehow when we design APIs we do grant ourselves that ability (for host-defined subclasses), but not consumers (for user-defined subclasses), which makes sense, but is a little weird, but I guess it  can be explained somehow","date":"2019-02-01T11:02:08.126Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"littledan","message":"Well, you can cook yourself up that behavior, it's just a bit obscure. Decorators will improve the ergonomics , and maybe we will have some kind of private declarations for another approach","date":"2019-02-01T11:03:08.122Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"littledan","message":"I'm not sure how we can work out the current vs relevant issue in the web; TC39 is fairly strongly on the \"current\" side where it makes sense","date":"2019-02-01T11:11:03.567Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"bterlson","message":"no, I'm just illustrating the general idea of local bindings need to be a binding identifier (no keyword) but otherwise keywords are np","date":"2018-03-15T21:13:53.603Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"spectranaut","message":"still I'd like clarification -- \"namespace\" is used as the \"exportName\" ExportEntry Record","date":"2018-03-15T21:17:06.448Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"bterlson","message":"spectranaut: sorry got pre-empted, yeah I would expect `export * as default from foo` to export the namespace object as the default export for the containing module I guess? morally like `export {v as default}` where v is some local binding.","date":"2018-03-15T21:26:06.304Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"aidansw","message":"That is fair, but I don't exactly get how it would make parsing harder.  From what I have seen(I have never done parsing so I wouldn't know) it just ends all multiline comments when it sees */.  But } for example doesn't have the same effect.  Why would */ not hav been made to behave basically the same as } but for comments?","date":"2019-04-13T05:26:51.824Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ljharb","message":"not really sure. i assume that with comments it has to be greedy - consuming everything until it sees a stop token - but with braces it has all sorts of grammar rules to apply","date":"2019-04-13T05:29:41.970Z","type":"message"}

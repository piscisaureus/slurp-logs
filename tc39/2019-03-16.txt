{"nick":"littledan","message":"ljharb: Is there any version of top-level await you could imagine that would address the virality concern (regardless of other issues people have raised)?","date":"2019-03-16T00:47:14.728Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ljharb","message":"yep! Maybe sugar for an AAIFE with import or import await? That makes adding TLA or import await not a breaking change (transparent) but using import await ensures all the bindings are available (desired behavior). Both sync and async static import would work with any module. (just came up with this now so i haven’t thought it through more than this comment)","date":"2019-03-16T00:50:23.635Z","type":"message"}

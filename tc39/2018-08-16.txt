{"nick":"arkain","message":"Bakkot: after looking at your \"protected\" decorators, I have to admit being a little torn. On the one hand, there's a definite elegance to splitting the problem into 2 parts (producer/consumer). On the other hand, nothing else in ES works like that with regards to prototype inheritance.

{"nick":"ljharb","message":"oh right duh, i'm thinking public fields","date":"2018-03-23T20:57:49.488Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ljharb","message":"ok so then the only thing i can think of is either as you said, consistency with other algs, or, because when decorators also arrive, they can dynamically create private names","date":"2018-03-23T20:58:21.641Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"caitp","message":"but, since each private name is unique and lexically scopped, the class's own `#private` won't be the same as the one some decorator sticks on it :x","date":"2018-03-23T21:00:21.901Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"caitp","message":"and presumably a decorator won't be able to declare it twice","date":"2018-03-23T21:00:52.086Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"ljharb","message":"if a decorator is able to make multiple private names, it could certainly try to declare it twice, i'd think","date":"2018-03-23T21:41:52.766Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"ljharb","message":"as far as i know","date":"2018-03-23T21:43:56.326Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"how does that even work","date":"2018-03-23T21:44:51.665Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"once the private is in the class you have no way of accessing it and nothing in the class is accessing it","date":"2018-03-23T21:45:28.854Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"devsnek","message":"so like","date":"2018-03-23T21:46:07.296Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ljharb","message":"ie, you wouldn't write `#foo` and have a decorator add it, a decorator would be able to use a private field as a hidden part of its own implementation","date":"2018-03-23T21:46:24.704Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"so basically like if you could pass v8's private symbols to jsland and decorators existed","date":"2018-03-23T21:46:54.629Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ljharb","message":"i dunno about v8's \"private symbols\"","date":"2018-03-23T21:47:24.422Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"caitp","message":"huh, the decorators proposal adds a new primitive type for private names, and  also adds new scoping rules for them","date":"2018-03-23T21:52:01.472Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"caitp","message":"that all seems unfortunate","date":"2018-03-23T21:52:04.479Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"caitp","message":"bit redundant to have both PrivateName and Symbol","date":"2018-03-23T21:52:32.631Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"yea thats like how i imagined it","date":"2018-03-23T21:53:26.531Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"v8 has something called a \"PrivateSymbol\" that they use with chrome to write parts of builtins in js","date":"2018-03-23T21:53:53.736Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"it sounds like the same thing","date":"2018-03-23T21:53:59.680Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"caitp","message":"PrivateSymbol in v8 is just a Symbol with a flag flipped, which is checked by some runtime functions to behave specially in rare cases","date":"2018-03-23T21:54:29.038Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"caitp","message":"not really a new primitive type or anything","date":"2018-03-23T21:54:46.568Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"new primitive seems like the same thing but less janky","date":"2018-03-23T21:54:53.096Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"caitp","message":"I think the thing you run into with making it a primitive is that makes it easier to leak from where it's supposed to live, which sort of makes its privacy a joke","date":"2018-03-23T21:55:42.372Z","type":"message"}

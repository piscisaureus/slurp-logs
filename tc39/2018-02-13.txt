{"nick":"Domenic","message":"So e.g. propdesc record fields would not opt-in; MOP internal methods would; module record methods would","date":"2018-02-13T22:17:32.927Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"bterlson","message":"Domenic: the problem is when I see the text [[Get]], do I auto-link to the MOP operation or the record that has a field of that name?","date":"2018-02-13T22:18:07.529Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"bterlson","message":"without static analysis I can't tell without marking the reference (rather than the definition)","date":"2018-02-13T22:18:25.207Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Domenic","message":"Well if only MOP internal methods opt in to being polymorphic then you'd only link to them","date":"2018-02-13T22:18:43.140Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"bterlson","message":"jschoi: looks good at a high level, though I think you could dispense with ins for entirely new clauses","date":"2018-02-22T23:40:01.798Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jschoi","message":"I really like how it automatically marks the date of generation as the default draft version number.","date":"2018-02-22T23:40:02.529Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jschoi","message":"Thanks!","date":"2018-02-22T23:40:15.523Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"bterlson","message":"we tend to just use ins/del for finer-grain changes","date":"2018-02-22T23:40:23.245Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jschoi","message":"Okay, so not so much for editors’ notes.","date":"2018-02-22T23:40:55.630Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"jschoi","message":"What about the new sections’ content?","date":"2018-02-22T23:41:29.371Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jschoi","message":"Should `<ins class=block>` be removed from them too?","date":"2018-02-22T23:41:36.389Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"bterlson","message":"I mean, there's no rule, but IMO if you're adding an entire clause, no ins needed, it's clearly new.","date":"2018-02-22T23:42:28.007Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"jschoi","message":"Right. Someone will manually merge the final proposal spec, I presume. No automatic merging by clause ID.","date":"2018-02-22T23:43:22.448Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jschoi","message":"*would","date":"2018-02-22T23:43:30.413Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"bterlson","message":"Yeah, that's done once you're ready for Stage 4. We can cross that bridge when the time comes.","date":"2018-02-22T23:43:56.976Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jschoi","message":"Ah, so that *is* how it’s done. Super cool.","date":"2018-02-22T23:44:07.809Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"not-an-aardvark","message":"It isn't the case non-proxy objects have some \"default\" coercion behavior which could be overridden by a Proxy (which would imply that the proxy could access the un-coerced version). Instead, `foo[bar]` means \"convert `bar` to a property key, and perform the [[Get]] operation with that key\". So coercion happens before the target object is involved.","date":"2018-03-18T02:51:11.794Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"littledan","message":"lots of people cross over between TS and JS, and understand them to correspond to each other; it seems reasonable to take TS into consideration","date":"2018-03-14T14:40:31.816Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"littledan","message":"yeah, so this is a good example of where TC39 is not going to do what TS does--even though a big segment of the community wants us to, there are some more subtle problems from it, e.g., when you want to evolve programs and not be held back by other code circumventing privacy protections","date":"2018-03-14T14:43:35.861Z","type":"message"}

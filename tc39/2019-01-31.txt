{"nick":"annevk","message":"bradleymeck: afaik MOP are constraints on objects; when you define a host object, you need lower-level hooks, such as OrdinaryGetOwnProperty and in this case \"has an own property\"","date":"2019-01-31T14:04:54.529Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"bradleymeck","message":"mmmm but this is changing how one of the methods on an object works from outside, maybe i'm confused","date":"2019-01-31T14:06:33.445Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"annevk","message":"sorry, exotic object","date":"2019-01-31T14:13:57.322Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"bradleymeck","message":"yea, but this seems new to me and i'm trying to process.","date":"2019-01-31T14:15:42.195Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"bradleymeck","message":"the exotic object is fine, the visibility algorithm is always within a MOP operation so it is probably fine to use","date":"2019-01-31T14:16:09.263Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"bradleymeck","message":"i think the prose we need to add is just about going through MOP operations *unless* you are creating an exotic object and are using things like \"has\" within a MOP operation implementation","date":"2019-01-31T14:17:03.166Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"bradleymeck","message":"that seems ok? will talk to ppl today at meeting in case they miss this","date":"2019-01-31T14:17:18.380Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"annevk","message":"Yeah, and does \"has\" need to be grounded better somehow?","date":"2019-01-31T14:17:51.135Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"bradleymeck","message":"using \"has\" outside of a MOP operation seems like something that would not be expected/should not be done","date":"2019-01-31T14:17:55.415Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"bradleymeck","message":"annevk: as an abstract op instead of a prose?","date":"2019-01-31T14:18:54.484Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"annevk","message":"No preference","date":"2019-01-31T14:19:00.779Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"annevk","message":"Although it does seem somewhat weird to me that not all of an object's layout is done using slots and abstract operations","date":"2019-01-31T14:19:19.470Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"bradleymeck","message":"annevk: idk, slots being used would still devolve to a list of entries/map of properties","date":"2019-01-31T14:20:14.505Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"bradleymeck","message":"this just isolates the spec level stuff from host/user level","date":"2019-01-31T14:20:45.113Z","type":"message"}

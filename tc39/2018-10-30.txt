{"nick":"TabAtkins","message":"annevk: Yeah, what ljharb said. Velocity is an easy one - there's a huge difference between a small positive and small negative velocity, as the two will send you in opposite directions over time. The fact that it's close enough to zero to not have any sigdigits after rounding doesn't change that.","date":"2018-10-30T16:11:39.872Z","type":"message"}

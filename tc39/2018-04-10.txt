{"nick":"vladi-dev","message":"hello everyone, i'd like to get some feedback about my proposal to JS syntax. Coming from Python I found that in JS import syntax is not very well suited for IDE's to hint variable/function names that you can import. Basically my proposal is to reverse the keywords in the import statement like so `from 'foo' import { bar}` so that IDE can show me which exports are available in module 'foo'.

{"nick":"jcrugzz","message":"juliangruber: no but that does sound like an interesting test. you'd think ipc is faster but i have no conception of the speed of unix sockets","date":"2014-01-20T23:31:51.525Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"othiym23","message":"it's a pain in the ass to benchmark, because at that point both are so fast that it's hard to get timing numbers that tell you much","date":"2014-01-20T23:34:18.576Z","type":"message"}

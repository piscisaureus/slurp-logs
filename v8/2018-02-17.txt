{"nick":"cjd","message":"mhm","date":"2018-02-17T00:05:56.817Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"microcolonel","message":"yeah, well the JS these days goes to bytecode","date":"2018-02-17T00:05:57.183Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"microcolonel","message":"and that bytecode is processed by an interpreter","date":"2018-02-17T00:06:05.583Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"microcolonel","message":"however, that interpreter is written in the assembler system used by the compilers in v8","date":"2018-02-17T00:06:31.053Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"cjd","message":"hydrogen / lithium still a thing ?","date":"2018-02-17T00:06:33.438Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"microcolonel","message":"so in order to run the interpreter, you have to implement the assembler","date":"2018-02-17T00:06:40.532Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"microcolonel","message":"still very different","date":"2018-02-17T00:07:54.924Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"cjd","message":"and it sort of symbolically executes the interpreter which outputs binary ?","date":"2018-02-17T00:08:01.148Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"microcolonel","message":"nah","date":"2018-02-17T00:08:11.540Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"microcolonel","message":"the assembler assembles the interpreter","date":"2018-02-17T00:08:17.028Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"microcolonel","message":"which runs as native code","date":"2018-02-17T00:08:19.355Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"microcolonel","message":"so basically you have to implement part of the JIT, so that it can assemble the interpreter","date":"2018-02-17T00:08:40.261Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"cjd","message":"ok","date":"2018-02-17T00:08:49.899Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"microcolonel","message":"I find it very impressive personally","date":"2018-02-17T00:09:18.839Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"cjd","message":"I always assumed it was just jitting pages and pages of native code and jumping to them","date":"2018-02-17T00:09:32.297Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"microcolonel","message":"well, jitting from what","date":"2018-02-17T00:09:45.895Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"cjd","message":"bytecode + profiling data ?","date":"2018-02-17T00:09:58.365Z","type":"message"}

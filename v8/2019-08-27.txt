{"nick":"basti_","message":"Hello people. I built a standalone v8 on ubuntu linux, using the \"gm\" script. How can I now install it so that d8 is executable from every directory (just like every other program)? When I try to run it from somewhere else than the build directory, it would die with an error message of blob files not being found - since they're in the build directory, that's no wonder. However, it is slightly unwieldly.","date":"2019-08-27T13:09:33.712Z","type":"message"}

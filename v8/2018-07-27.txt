{"nick":"trigen","message":"Hi there, I have a question. I didn't reduce it to a small test case yet, but I am trying to embed v8 in my program, this worked before but now I've updated the v8 checkout and I get a segfault: https://pastebin.com/QBhR1gy2 I was wondering if anyone can hint me towards what may be wrong? I'm statically linking it","date":"2018-07-27T14:59:54.564Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"behelit","message":"marja___: what i want is a process that runs (forever), accepts some code to run, some more code that should be able to access variables defined in the previous code, then a reset-command, then new code etc.","date":"2014-03-21T15:17:48.194Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"behelit","message":"the code run after the reset-command should not be able to access anything from stuff run prior to reset; code running before reset should not be able to mess with code running after rest.","date":"2014-03-21T15:18:32.570Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"marja___","message":"like, have a func which checks if the next script should run in the same context, if not, then return, and then caller then calls it again, or something like that.","date":"2014-03-21T15:22:36.174Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mhdawson","message":"I think you added the addon tests to the regular ci run.  Do you know if there would be an easy way to disable them just for AIX while we figure out  what's going on ?","date":"2016-08-24T14:36:43.202Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mhdawson","message":"yes I think the problem is that the tests sometimes start to run before the  AIX build steps complete.  Most likely a gyp dependency issue, but I'm not familiar enough with gyp to have figured out what yet","date":"2016-08-24T14:48:57.995Z","type":"message"}

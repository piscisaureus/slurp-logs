{"nick":"Trott","message":"Jenkins is doing that thing a lot lately where it feels like the website is blocking on a single thread somehow. Like, click something and it spin spins spins, so open another tab to look at something else on Jenkins, and it spins spins spins, repeat two more times, then all four tabs suddenly all load at once.","date":"2018-04-07T04:06:58.289Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Trott","message":"At least it's not giving 504 (or whatever the code was) errors like it used to. So that's definitely an improvement. I'm not really complaining. Just observing in case anyone knows what it is and/or is interested in investigating. It would be cooler if the wait-wait-wait didn't happen, but I can totally live with it.","date":"2018-04-07T04:08:02.498Z","type":"message"}

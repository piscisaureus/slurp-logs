{"nick":"Trott","message":"https://ci.nodejs.org/computer/test-softlayer-ubuntu1604_sharedlibs_container-x64-5/builds is showing a 20 red builds in a row, probably all due to sequential/test-cpu-prof suddenly timing out all the time. I'm going to disable the host and see if that fixes things.","date":"2019-06-11T05:39:09.480Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Trott","message":"Yes, that seems to have \"fixed\" things by having test-softlayer-ubuntu1604_sharedlibs_container-x64-7 jump in and start handling stuff and it's working fine. Who handles our softlayer hosts? Or should I just reboot test-softlayer-ubuntu1604_sharedlibs_container-x64-5 and see what happens?","date":"2019-06-11T06:02:24.355Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"Trott","message":"Ugh, nope, I spoke too soon. Timing out on test-softlayer-ubuntu1604_sharedlibs_container-x64-7 too. (I thought it was in parallel but it's in sequential.) This is bad. Timing out on est-softlayer-ubuntu1604_sharedlibs_container-x64-2 as well. I'll put -5 back in the rotation as it's not host-specific.","date":"2019-06-11T06:12:17.807Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"rvagg","message":"refack: `-Xmx16g -Xms8g` - you've just reduced what I already reduced. It was, and has been, at 32G for ages. That machine has 32G of RAM and the JVM does a lot of caching so it's not terrible that Jenkins uses a lot of memory. I reduced it to 24G but the fact that we're still at \"unresponsive\" suggests the problem is elsewhere. It'll be interesting if 16G makes a difference but it's potentially wasting resources.","date":"2018-09-11T01:31:11.719Z","type":"message"}

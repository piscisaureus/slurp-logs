{"nick":"ljharb","message":"binarious: because babel/browserify/etc doesn't work by default on node_modules, and you're forcing your users to do a compile step if you publish uncompiled code","date":"2015-09-17T12:07:10.398Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ljharb","message":"binarious: ideally you'd only ever publish commonJS ES5.","date":"2015-09-17T12:07:22.069Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"binarious","message":"ljharb: There modules just hold functionality we use in all of our apps. These modules never will be published to the public.","date":"2015-09-17T12:07:24.022Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"ljharb","message":"the benefit of precompiling is that each module is 100% responsible for itself.","date":"2015-09-17T12:08:29.190Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"binarious","message":"ljharb: I include 3rd party scripts in this modules. E. g. ngTable. When I compile this, ngTable is included in the resulting js file, isn’t it? Seems not nice to me.","date":"2015-09-17T12:09:01.168Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"zkat","message":"doesn't babel have a concat option?","date":"2015-09-17T12:10:25.219Z","type":"message"}

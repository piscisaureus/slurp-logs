{"nick":"rhls94","message":"even though node js or libuv is using thread pool in background , why it's not using full strength of the multiple cores of processor","date":"2019-10-08T19:50:33.803Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rhls94","message":"confusion is with usage of multiple threads in background by libuv , and if every request contains a file read , node will do that asynchronously  by libuv  -in which its use thread pool, as there no OS support like epoll, kqueue, etc .. for file access. in turn its multi threaded right )?","date":"2019-10-08T19:51:54.873Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rhls94","message":"I am more confused after read libuv documentation which used by node js , i just wanted to know why there is no much usage of multiple core even after under the hood its using a thread pool, what will be the mechanism","date":"2019-10-08T19:53:16.842Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"addaleax","message":"rhls94: I’ve tried to give you some pointers in the nodejs/help issue that you opened … basically, if most of what you do is running JS code, then you will be using all cores fully because running JS code is still single-threaded","date":"2019-10-08T19:55:02.877Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"addaleax","message":"and fs operations are running on the threadpool but take only very little CPU time","date":"2019-10-08T19:55:24.047Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rhls94","message":"so as you explained , there is no additional mechanism, or there is no difference between the threads created by the other web servers for each request and threads created by the libuv","date":"2019-10-08T19:57:46.284Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rhls94","message":"its matter of volume of the threads created , that decide the usage of other cores ?","date":"2019-10-08T19:58:31.116Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"addaleax","message":"rhls94: threaded webservers and libuv work very differently; creating many threads is actually somewhat inefficient if their number exceeds the number of cores on the machine and they just spend a lot of time waiting for data from the other end of the socket","date":"2019-10-08T20:06:12.782Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"addaleax","message":"sure","date":"2019-10-08T20:09:54.233Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"addaleax","message":"rhls94: if you do want to use multiple threads running JS code in a single Node.js process, that’s what Workers are there for; but whether they are better than child processes depends a lot on your concrete use case","date":"2019-10-08T20:10:32.569Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"addaleax","message":"for a webserver creating multiple child processes is perfectly fine","date":"2019-10-08T20:10:44.826Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rhls94","message":"my doubt was , even though libuv creates threads then what makes it different from multi threaded servers, for network sockets its ok, OS provides supports like epoll and all","date":"2019-10-08T20:13:09.487Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"addaleax","message":"rhls94: the number of threads in the pool is fixed, so it doesn’t grow when there are more connections, and the libuv threadpool works off tasks as they come, rather than waiting for I/O indefinitely","date":"2019-10-08T20:14:09.781Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rhls94","message":"so i read that , default maximum threads in libuv thread pool is 4 , that's why its not using other core rather than one which node process runs , am i correct ?","date":"2019-10-08T20:15:50.523Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"addaleax","message":"rhls94: if it’s not using the thread pool then that has nothing to do with the number of threads in the pool, it just means that there is no work that would run on the thread pool, which most likely means that your main thread is busy running JS and not scheduling I/O operations","date":"2019-10-08T20:17:41.859Z","type":"message"}

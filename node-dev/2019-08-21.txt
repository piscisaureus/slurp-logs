{"nick":"srl295","message":"@MylesBorins so very WIPy but https://github.com/srl295/docker-node/commits/full-icu","date":"2019-08-21T19:03:07.861Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"MylesBorins","message":"srl295 so for k8s the image gets deduped if it identical","date":"2019-08-21T19:05:18.479Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"MylesBorins","message":"\"If they’re identical, they’re deduped on a single VM but node:10-alpine is probably updated v frequently So i wouldn’t expect a lot of deduping\"","date":"2019-08-21T19:05:23.834Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"MylesBorins","message":"so if any of the images that the node image depends on are updated, e.g. alpine, then the layer will not be deduped in deployment.","date":"2019-08-21T19:05:56.990Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"srl295","message":"so for the image, you could change the build to load ICU as a system library","date":"2019-08-21T19:06:07.854Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"srl295","message":"basically, have a layer that's just ICU. could be an idea","date":"2019-08-21T19:06:59.336Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"MylesBorins","message":"that could definitely be an idea","date":"2019-08-21T19:07:29.897Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"MylesBorins","message":"I mean offering different containers could be a solution to this problem too","date":"2019-08-21T19:07:41.606Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"MylesBorins","message":"considering that we already have n containers vs 1 official release","date":"2019-08-21T19:07:52.424Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"srl295","message":"hm, but if the base layer changes, it won't help.   Yeah, you could easily have a small-icu container","date":"2019-08-21T19:07:59.455Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"MylesBorins","message":"as a shorter term solution","date":"2019-08-21T19:08:34.721Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"MylesBorins","message":"checking about how this may effect cold start times wtih both the k8s expert and someone I know who does a TON of serverless","date":"2019-08-21T19:08:36.702Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"srl295","message":"i don't think we should remove small-icu/no-icu, there's probably enough demand for it","date":"2019-08-21T19:08:37.060Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mgol","date":"2019-08-21T19:11:33.803Z","type":"join"}
{"nick":"srl295","message":"yeah, `apk --update add icu` in alpine adds a recent enough ICU. i'll make an image with that strategy","date":"2019-08-21T19:11:55.720Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"MylesBorins","message":"if we do it that way we get the mmap though right?","date":"2019-08-21T19:12:33.756Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"MylesBorins","message":"lol","date":"2019-08-21T19:12:34.820Z","type":"message"}

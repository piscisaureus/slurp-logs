{"nick":"guybedford","message":"exactly","date":"2018-09-28T15:00:14.126Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"and then make a bunch of changes to script origins","date":"2018-09-28T15:00:21.656Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"this is also needed for web assembly - see https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/1311","date":"2018-09-28T15:00:41.264Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"yeah","date":"2018-09-28T15:00:45.418Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"it's definitely a good first step","date":"2018-09-28T15:00:54.149Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"rn script origin had a wasm flag and a esm flag","date":"2018-09-28T15:00:58.135Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"so you can flip one or both","date":"2018-09-28T15:01:05.706Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"I considered trying the hack approach first of flagging modules just to get something done","date":"2018-09-28T15:01:05.854Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"good suggestion","date":"2018-09-28T15:01:20.812Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"I think there needs to be a new api","date":"2018-09-28T15:01:35.574Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"how so?","date":"2018-09-28T15:01:54.664Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"where origin gets told internally instead of having the flags","date":"2018-09-28T15:01:56.378Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"ah right","date":"2018-09-28T15:02:22.659Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"it would be nice if yang was ever on irc","date":"2018-09-28T15:02:27.046Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"that sounds like something that can be worked out with v8 exactly","date":"2018-09-28T15:02:38.748Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"In terms of getting there, I just wanted to hack something together that works first though","date":"2018-09-28T15:03:08.817Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"sure","date":"2018-09-28T15:03:12.940Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"because the TC39 feedback was specifically \"follow implementation\"","date":"2018-09-28T15:03:17.287Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"regardless of whether that implementation is merged yet or not","date":"2018-09-28T15:03:23.628Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"the tricky edge cases is that the namespace is being extended after initial creation","date":"2018-09-28T15:03:47.498Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"ideally this would be handled by creating the namespace for dynamic modules only after execution to avoid \"mutation\"","date":"2018-09-28T15:04:13.340Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"I think that's the biggest aspect of implementation concern","date":"2018-09-28T15:04:29.596Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"(the namespace is extended only in the rare edge case that is)","date":"2018-09-28T15:04:45.614Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"well namespaces need to be available after instantiation afaik","date":"2018-09-28T15:04:53.082Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"so the spec is about specifically ensuring that it is not accessible before execution","date":"2018-09-28T15:05:09.464Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"so dynamic modules having undefined namespaces on instantiation doesn't need to be a problem","date":"2018-09-28T15:05:23.758Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"but that may hit up against other internal assumptions yes","date":"2018-09-28T15:05:47.942Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"so the alternative would just be to \"reconstruct\" the namespace","date":"2018-09-28T15:05:58.303Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"note that namespaces aren't actually created after instantiation in the spec though","date":"2018-09-28T15:06:23.040Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"they're only created \"on demand\" from a spec perspective","date":"2018-09-28T15:06:30.330Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"what I just see is imported names that turn into reference errors at runtime instead of linking errors","date":"2018-09-28T15:06:38.336Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"because of how namespaces are used","date":"2018-09-28T15:07:04.228Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"FYI the v8 approach is described in the \"namespaces\" section here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1umh5xCe3VxGAAnNfIuQwHtRKXKIC_bkoz41hFs8I5YI/edit#heading=h.l4o2ixp6kjpu","date":"2018-09-28T15:07:35.964Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"on briefly reading it seems like v8 does call it for all modules on instantiate","date":"2018-09-28T15:08:03.783Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"the spec doesn't actually mandate that these objects are constructed","date":"2018-09-28T15:08:19.174Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"yeah basically just skip that check and add an API to set properties on namespaces","date":"2018-09-28T15:08:36.670Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"so shiftng dynamic modules to instantiate specifically could be ok so far as we can isolatea all v8 assumptions there","date":"2018-09-28T15:08:44.903Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"yup exactly","date":"2018-09-28T15:08:50.987Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"the API only works up until execution has completed though - then it is locked down","date":"2018-09-28T15:09:02.229Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"we can rely on execution order ensuring namespaces are not accessible too given the way that the spec isolates the edge cases again","date":"2018-09-28T15:09:25.820Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"ye","date":"2018-09-28T15:09:32.297Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"Module<T> where T is SourceText or Dynamic would be an easy check in that function","date":"2018-09-28T15:09:40.969Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"right","date":"2018-09-28T15:09:47.564Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"honestly I think the hardest part here will be the API design","date":"2018-09-28T15:10:09.047Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"which aspect of it?","date":"2018-09-28T15:10:23.184Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"you mean what the DynamicModule class exposes?","date":"2018-09-28T15:10:47.293Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"or the ways it interacts with other things like the origin handling etc","date":"2018-09-28T15:11:05.298Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"all of it lol","date":"2018-09-28T15:12:24.520Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"yeah so a good first step is probably to do the class refactoring","date":"2018-09-28T15:12:55.204Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"Basically, a simple refactoring commit that just splits up SourceTextModule and Module or wahtever we want to call it","date":"2018-09-28T15:13:25.200Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"Since v8 will need that anyway, it is useful work regardless","date":"2018-09-28T15:13:36.763Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybedford","message":"then a second step to add dynamic","date":"2018-09-28T15:13:42.344Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"guybedford","message":"ok","date":"2018-09-28T15:14:18.423Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"yoody","message":"Hi all, sorry if this is a noobie question. I'm embedding nodejs in an application I'm working on as a dynamic library, all is working well except I can't figure out a reliable way to get the address of nodes exported Start function as the offset sometimes changes from the base address of the dll. Can anyone point me in the direction of doing this correctly please?","date":"2019-06-21T13:03:15.965Z","type":"message"}

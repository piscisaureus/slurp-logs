{"nick":"Trott","message":"Seems like the subsystem we usually use for worker_threads commits is `worker` although `workers` has been used a little bit. Doesn't look like we ever used `worker_threads` which is what our docs would seem to suggest. None of these are in `core-validate-commit` and I'm thinking we should add `worker_threads` and start using it as the most obvious/user-friendly/automatable-in-the-future approach.","date":"2018-12-24T14:41:54.455Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"devsnek","message":"oh wow","date":"2020-01-25T01:49:44.413Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"joyee","message":"There are similar files for nightlies at https://nodejs.org/download/nightly/index.json but for commit hash mappings I think you'll have to checkout the branch and look at deps/v8/include/v8-version.h","date":"2020-01-25T01:51:41.683Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"joyee","message":"shu: I don't think I've seen something like that. Node.js applications typically have either the main context or vm contexts (if it creates any), the main context basically lives as long as the application is alive. I don't think there's option to make a vm context invalid from JS land..","date":"2020-01-25T01:55:45.796Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"devsnek","message":"was gonna say, if its v8 functionality i could expose it on the new context api","date":"2020-01-25T01:56:50.598Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"shu","message":"from v8's POV, as long as the Context exists it's good to execute code","date":"2020-01-25T01:58:01.936Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"shu","message":"but from the host's POV, sometimes you might not want to even if the Context is still alive, if the frame has already navigated away","date":"2020-01-25T01:58:59.377Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"at that point i'd hope there was no more js","date":"2020-01-25T01:59:32.002Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"shu","message":"well, you can reach into an iframe and keep references to its objects","date":"2020-01-25T01:59:59.735Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"shu","message":"and then remove the iframe","date":"2020-01-25T02:00:11.424Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"oh hmm","date":"2020-01-25T02:00:15.693Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"shu","message":"anyways yeah it's bizarro","date":"2020-01-25T02:00:53.384Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"shu","message":"this is less bizarro for FinalizationGroup cleanups, since those are scheduled ahead of time","date":"2020-01-25T02:01:12.230Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"shu","message":"if an iframe has been removed by the time the cleanups got around to being called by the event loop, should they still do anything?","date":"2020-01-25T02:01:39.496Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"shu","message":"current thinking is no","date":"2020-01-25T02:01:47.213Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"joyee","message":"I don't think I have seen similar concepts in node core, there might be in user land projects that make heavy use of vm (jest or jsdom?)","date":"2020-01-25T02:02:11.572Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"oh this is artificial limitations","date":"2020-01-25T02:02:55.611Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"shu","message":"also not sure what that means :)","date":"2020-01-25T02:03:10.042Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"I dunno as long as an object is reachable I'd expect the browser to acknowledge it's existence","date":"2020-01-25T02:03:14.514Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"devsnek","message":"no I just didn't immediately understand why there would need to be any special rules and finalization groups and contexts","date":"2020-01-25T02:03:48.976Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"s/and/about","date":"2020-01-25T02:03:58.572Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"shu","message":"well, one could say that cleanups must always be called, even if the frame is navigated","date":"2020-01-25T02:04:50.865Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"shu","message":"but that's kind of strange, or at least very wasteful","date":"2020-01-25T02:04:57.575Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"shu","message":"since presumably everything that it might cleanup is gone","date":"2020-01-25T02:05:05.646Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"well if they're gone they're gone","date":"2020-01-25T02:05:26.339Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"shu","message":"in any case this sounds like a non-issue for node","date":"2020-01-25T02:05:34.063Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"and finalization doesn't do anything","date":"2020-01-25T02:05:34.603Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"i mean we have a concept of collecting a context while objects created in that context still exist","date":"2020-01-25T02:05:54.884Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"joyee","message":"I believe ultimately the obj would keep the context alive in GC","date":"2020-01-25T02:07:54.698Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"shu","message":"bradleymeck: agreed, in this case it's something to be specced on the html integration side for weakrefs","date":"2020-01-25T02:36:29.106Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"bradleymeck","message":"i know they are doing something a bit odd but don't have direct knowledge of the codebase except through dialog on calls","date":"2020-01-25T02:46:06.742Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"shu","message":"bradleymeck: ah, interesting datapoint","date":"2020-01-25T02:46:17.784Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"shu","message":"indeed i know historically running script in detached iframes is supported","date":"2020-01-25T02:46:31.004Z","type":"message"}

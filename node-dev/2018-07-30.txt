{"nick":"devsnek","message":"this is a confusing issue ugh","date":"2018-07-30T00:48:19.122Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"devsnek","message":"there's not much we can do unless the new module type lands in 262","date":"2018-07-30T00:51:16.125Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"I think we can change the ESM translator to at least don't use the same filename","date":"2018-07-30T00:51:33.875Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"we definitely should be using the file:// url for that module","date":"2018-07-30T00:52:26.582Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"for what module?","date":"2018-07-30T00:53:08.729Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"const module = new ModuleWrap(reexports, `${url}`);","date":"2018-07-30T00:53:18.422Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"I'm not sure I agree","date":"2018-07-30T00:53:31.274Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"its the url that gets put into our module map","date":"2018-07-30T00:53:42.660Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"Oh","date":"2018-07-30T00:54:03.683Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"I didn't know the ModuleWrap url gets used in that way","date":"2018-07-30T00:54:16.997Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"oh it doesn't get used from `.url`","date":"2018-07-30T00:54:25.343Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"but then we lose the ability to tell where a ModuleWrap came from if we don't use the url its associated with","date":"2018-07-30T00:54:42.969Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"We could do the same thing with `cjs-facade:`","date":"2018-07-30T00:55:23.014Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"cjs-facade doesn't go in the module map","date":"2018-07-30T00:55:37.134Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"i'm surprised it didn't show up on that guy's console.log","date":"2018-07-30T00:55:52.391Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"(there's a scheme check in c8)","date":"2018-07-30T00:56:05.508Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"oh ok","date":"2018-07-30T00:56:13.492Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"well, we could then not use the url attached to the ModuleWrap in the module map","date":"2018-07-30T00:56:26.088Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"right now url is created before ModuleJob even exists","date":"2018-07-30T00:56:50.078Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"because the current situation is IMO bad and needs to be fixed","date":"2018-07-30T00:56:59.563Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"i think the fix is dynamic module records","date":"2018-07-30T00:57:08.647Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"Okay: https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/lib/internal/modules/esm/loader.js#L135-L139","date":"2018-07-30T00:57:31.387Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"so the `url` used for the module map isn't coming from the translator in anyway","date":"2018-07-30T00:57:53.702Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"no","date":"2018-07-30T00:58:00.428Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"which means that we can call `createDynamicModule` in the CJS handler with another URL than the file name URL","date":"2018-07-30T00:58:37.241Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"without messing up the module map","date":"2018-07-30T00:58:44.782Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"you could pass `timothy` for the url every time","date":"2018-07-30T00:59:02.189Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"v8 doesn't care","date":"2018-07-30T00:59:06.278Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"i would say lets see what happens with dynamic module records and then we can run around worrying about this if those don't go through","date":"2018-07-30T00:59:19.030Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"exactly, V8 doesn't care","date":"2018-07-30T00:59:30.058Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"so we should just use another URL for `createDynamicModule` instead of messing up downstream expectations","date":"2018-07-30T00:59:56.172Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"and dynamic module records are at least a few years out","date":"2018-07-30T01:00:09.072Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"using something non-obvious for that wrapper url kills debugging though","date":"2018-07-30T01:00:52.723Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"and if its obvious people will confuse it","date":"2018-07-30T01:01:05.213Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"yeah we could just use another scheme","date":"2018-07-30T01:01:28.354Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"and what do you need debugging for? Except for Node.js core development","date":"2018-07-30T01:01:55.723Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"like, there's nothing in that wrapper lol, except `import { executor, $default } from ''; export { $default as default }; if (typeof executor === \"function\") executor();`","date":"2018-07-30T01:04:05.400Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"i suppose we could do like `wrapper://` or something","date":"2018-07-30T01:04:34.434Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"it should be obvious to users too","date":"2018-07-30T01:04:38.024Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"they have to deal with it while debugging stuff","date":"2018-07-30T01:04:44.607Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"having a dedicated scheme would also aid debugging as they can just blackbox the whole scheme","date":"2018-07-30T01:05:41.595Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"sure","date":"2018-07-30T01:05:48.480Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"devsnek","message":"i'm going to just be super optimistic and assume that dynamic record makes 8 months","date":"2018-07-30T01:06:12.187Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"addaleax","message":"boneskull: I think it’s mostly: Workers have a full API available inside them; Workers don’t use globals for communication; We don’t use EventTarget-style APIs, but rather provide Node.js-style EventListener APIs … not much more than that?","date":"2019-02-01T19:34:44.740Z","type":"message"}

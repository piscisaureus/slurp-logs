{"nick":"Trott","message":"Not sure yet. I thought refack had it fixed because he had a successful run on the windows CI but it sounds like now maybe he was just testing something out. If I'm understanding correctly, there will be some refactoring on master to make it compatible with VS2017, and so it sounds like a rebase. On the upside, no releases but the security releases next week, so there's no rush to get anything landed because it can't go out","date":"2019-02-22T21:36:35.848Z","type":"message"}

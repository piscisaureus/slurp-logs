{"nick":"Trott","message":"Anyone want to try running the script I posted at https://stackoverflow.com/a/57229218/436641 to see if it reports interleaved output or not? I'm unable to make multiple independent processes calling `fs.appendFile()` on the same file result in interleaved output. This surprises me and makes me wonder if I'm doing something wrong. Or maybe it's OS/file-system dependent? (I'm on macOS Mojave.)","date":"2019-07-27T04:54:35.872Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"joyee","message":"I think it's better","date":"2018-03-23T18:07:57.453Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Trott","message":"I think the thing to do is to have `common.expectsError(` on a line by itself, then all the arguments indented, then the close parenthesis on a line by itself so it's aligned with the `common.expectsError(` line.","date":"2018-03-23T18:08:01.515Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Trott","message":"Alternatively, assign each argument to variable so you can just have `common.expectsError(foo, bar);`","date":"2018-03-23T18:08:17.215Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"Trott","message":"It will make sure indentation is right, but ensuring readability will sometimes be an art rather than a science.","date":"2018-03-23T18:08:46.067Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"Trott","message":"So, if you run that across all the tests, it will probably be rejected as pointless churn. But if you run it on a test that you are already working on, AWESOME. That's what I predict the reaction will be. :_D","date":"2018-03-23T18:09:27.295Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Trott","message":":-D","date":"2018-03-23T18:09:28.682Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"joyee","message":"I think indentation like this is just hard to guess right in linters because there are too many states involved, and JS is not like python where indentation carries semantics so you can have so many valid ways to indent it","date":"2018-03-23T18:09:54.448Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ryzokuken","message":"Okay, so should I run prettier on every test I touch? (for other reasons than to reformat it, ofcourse)","date":"2018-03-23T18:10:30.561Z","type":"message"}

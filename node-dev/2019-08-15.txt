{"nick":"addaleax","message":"bradleymeck: another non-trivial issue with the modules_wrap.cc code for fs operations is that it’s all synchronous even though it doesn’t need to be, and that’s much more easily handled well in JS land","date":"2019-08-15T11:45:28.466Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"addaleax","message":"bradleymeck: yeah, but there’s reasons for that … my disk isn’t the fastest and I can’t tell you how often I’ve wished that people would use async fs operations instead of sync ones to speed that up when things *aren’t* in the OS cache","date":"2019-08-15T11:47:10.160Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"joyee","message":"The bottleneck of the startup performance is the JS compilation, and since our code is a bit of spaghetti, if you want to require one native JS module, you potentially require a bunch of other stuff that you don't need, and it incurs a cross boundary call - if most of that is not JS anymore, the bottleneck would be partially gone","date":"2018-11-06T02:23:39.220Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"ljharb","message":"ok so, apparently node 10 has an `fs/promises` module. however, while `require('fs')` will always pull the core module, and `require('fs/')` will always pull `node_modules/fs/`, wouldn't `require('fs/promises')` newly shadow node_modules? if it's `node_modules/fs/promises.js`, how would you require that file without providing the extension?","date":"2018-05-02T06:35:34.442Z","type":"message"}

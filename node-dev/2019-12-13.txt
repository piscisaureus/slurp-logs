{"nick":"wwigham","message":"Is anyone here familiar with the v8 changes that went into node 13.2? I'm seeing massive slowdowns in the debug protocol between 13.1 and 13.2. We opened https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/30926 to track the problem; given how little node mucks with it, though, it's probably an issue with v8's own inspector/debugger APIs","date":"2019-12-13T00:26:44.387Z","type":"message"}

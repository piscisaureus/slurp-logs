{"nick":"Trott","message":"boneskull: In case nobody answered your earlier question, Reviewed-by metadata is added automatically by `node-core-utils` when you use `git node land`. If you only want to add the metadata, there might be a way to run `git node land --amend` or something like that. joyee would be the person to know all the details like that if it's not clear from the documentation etc.","date":"2019-06-15T03:30:26.923Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"Trott","message":"Anyway, there's no easy answer to the question. You need to read the code and figure out how to use exposed methods to get to the unexposed methods. If it's not actually possible for the unexposed code to execute, then it needs to be removed, of course. And using a debugger to step through the code can help, of course.","date":"2018-09-17T01:54:07.564Z","type":"message"}

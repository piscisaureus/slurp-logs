{"nick":"joyee","message":"hemx: using `tools/test.py test/paralell/test-name.js` will run the test with the default args (e.g. use release build). I don't think there is a convenient short cut to get the coverage with a single test, you can probably grok the Makefile to get the environment variables and flags passed to the test runner to generate coverage, and run that manually with the test path as argument, and then generate the report again","date":"2019-02-12T02:10:30.742Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"joyee","message":"devsnek: that looks like a different topic though, the CI failure looks like a genuine bug in the external string code. It's hitting the resource limit of the system and getting killed whereas it's supposed to check and return an empty maybe if the external resource cannot be allocated.","date":"2018-08-13T23:23:02.376Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"joyee","message":"V8's heap is pretty small, and considering strings coming out of buffers are pretty simple - just contiguous storage","date":"2018-08-13T23:29:53.822Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"joyee","message":"Or Node is smart enough to do that for you - considering it's server-side JS","date":"2018-08-13T23:35:38.007Z","type":"message"}

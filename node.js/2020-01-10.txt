{"nick":"joepie91","message":"kapil_: so one thing to keep in mind is that Rust very strongly demands that your code is correct; not as much as a \"formal proof\", but it will certainly disallow a lot of things if it can't figure out whether it's safe to do them... so especially initially, you should expect to be spending a lot of time learning how to write the code correctly, and how to convince the compiler that it *is* correct","date":"2020-01-10T15:52:15.312Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"joepie91","message":"however, if you try to 'cheat' the compiler and write code that mostly sorta works and it's \"good enough\" and you don't care about the correctness, then Rust will be less productive :) but I don't think that's a good goal to have","date":"2020-01-10T15:53:48.882Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"joepie91","message":"a big part of the productivity benefit of Rust is in the concurrency handling, though; multi-threading, that sort of thing... it's much\u000f easier to write concurrent code in Rust than it is in C++, because the compiler verifies for you that you're not causing data races and your code is actually multithreading-safe","date":"2020-01-10T15:54:36.154Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"joepie91","message":"s3a: I'm about to sleep, so I'll have to keep it short, but: your package.json specifies what dependencies are acceptable, and uses semantic versioning ranges (ie. expressed as \"this version or any later version that is compatible\"), package-lock.json contains the *exact* versions and their hashes when you installed the packages","date":"2019-10-22T23:55:46.236Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"jaawerth","message":"NJSn00b: well, it appears that you're calling resolve() on a function call that doesn't return anything, which is why you would get undefined. new Promise can be used to wrap callback-based async functions by using resolve/reject in the callback, but it's a lot easier to use the promisify function in the core lib","date":"2018-02-16T23:47:48.014Z","type":"message"}

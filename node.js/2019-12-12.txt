{"nick":"samsch","message":"There's really only two \"correct\" solutions: Either fully embrace ESM, and `import React from 'react';` shouldn't work at all (no default export), and JSX default pragma would be changed to `createElement`; or fully embrace CJS style, where `import { useEffect } from 'react';` wouldn't work, and everything is used as a property of the React object.","date":"2019-12-12T15:56:10.978Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"samsch","message":"In the second case, you would only have `import React from 'react';` when using react from an ES module. Perhaps ironically, this would still allow `const { useEffect } = require('react');` in CJS files.","date":"2019-12-12T15:57:30.934Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"yengas","message":"yea but whats the point of maintaining 5 different packages when i can just maintain 1 or 2. i suppose having separate commit history and versioning for parsers could be helpful","date":"2018-03-04T15:32:35.029Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"yengas","message":"but i thought it would be possible to have something like defining the source code directory for the package which solves most of my problems","date":"2018-03-04T15:33:01.468Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"joepie91","message":"you no longer need to pull in everything to get one bit of it (see eg. your tree shaking question), you can fairly safely make a particular package unmaintained or replace it with a new package without affecting the rest, each has its own version/commit history so it's easier to track functionality changes, you're pretty much forced to make them loosely coupled which helps code maintenance, etc.","date":"2018-03-04T15:34:10.302Z","type":"message"}

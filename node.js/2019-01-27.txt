{"nick":"DLSteve","message":"Seems more like a process issue. I usually define the API up front and what it's requirements are before I do any major development. One launched any changes to the schema that would break downstream clients has to be released as a new version of the API.","date":"2019-01-27T15:51:27.618Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"feelextra","message":"DLSteve: suppose i do that, and my API says `/foo endpoint returns a JSON object that has the property name and the value is between 1 and 256 characters`. how do you enforce such rule? if you don't enforce it then the backend's behavior could be completely different and some usages will fail just due to bad documentation not covering a use case.","date":"2019-01-27T15:54:27.528Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"feelextra","message":"basically the API design and implementation being inconsistent is what bothers me. changes will always be needed somewhere down the line (unless this is some rare service which somehow never has to change its requirements)","date":"2019-01-27T15:56:41.300Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"DLSteve","message":"right, they can be more consistent. I haven't seen anything that enforces schema and also does documentation. In theory you could build the spec in swagger and have some sort of validator library that hooks into that.","date":"2019-01-27T15:58:59.219Z","type":"message"}

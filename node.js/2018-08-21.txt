{"nick":"Lope2","message":"zsoc, GreenJello, _rgn, grr12314, I figured it out! By writing a simple test, the simple test worked, and then I realized what the problem was. I was downloading foo-junk.jpg and saving it as foo.jpg, then downloading foo.jpg and saving it as foo.jpg asynchronously. So the corrupt images happen under race conditions when the 2nd file to arrive is smaller than the first.","date":"2018-08-21T15:57:08.125Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"zsoc","message":"yeah if you're not super familiar with how race conditions are caused.. they can slip in easily, that's why i usually suggest flipping to { concurrency: 1 } if you're trying to isolate weird behavior","date":"2018-08-21T15:58:15.592Z","type":"message"}

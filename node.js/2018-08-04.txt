{"nick":"joepie91","message":"like for example something that claims to be 'the fastest implementation' but doesn't explain what makes it faster than others, automatically ends up on my 'distrust' list","date":"2018-08-04T23:52:43.567Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"joepie91","message":"and I won't use it until I've reviewed the code, because there's probably a hidden tradeoff","date":"2018-08-04T23:52:55.991Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"joepie91","message":"quarters: but yeah, you should basically think of it like this: you want to pick your dependencies such that mistakes are cheap to make","date":"2018-08-04T23:53:47.833Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"joepie91","message":"if you have a dependency that does precisely one well-defined thing, then worst case it ends up not working reliably and you replace it with an alternative or even your own implementation","date":"2018-08-04T23:54:10.938Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"joepie91","message":"since it only does one thing, the cost for doing that is low; there's no ecosystem buy-in","date":"2018-08-04T23:54:18.795Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"joepie91","message":"so the lower the cost of mistakes, the better option a dependency is","date":"2018-08-04T23:54:40.887Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"joepie91","message":"this is all kind of rooted in the realization that you *will* make a mistake, because every human does, because humans are fallible... so you might as well optimize for that","date":"2018-08-04T23:55:17.825Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"joepie91","message":"quarters: anyway, I find documentation to also be a good indicator; if the documentation for a library is clear about what it does, what the API is, etc. then that tells me that the author probably thought through how it works (because once you have, writing the docs is cheap)","date":"2018-08-04T23:56:25.855Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"joepie91","message":"if it's just a usage example that doesn't seem to specify all of the functionality, that's a red flag because it's likely that the author just adds stuff as they find themselves needing it, without really considering how coherent the resulting API is","date":"2018-08-04T23:56:56.904Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"joepie91","message":"(once again, exceptions exist, and to determine those I can always just read the code)","date":"2018-08-04T23:57:13.142Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"joepie91","message":"in practice, modular does-a-single-thing dependencies are usually very small, to the point that reading their code takes maybe 5-10 minutes","date":"2018-08-04T23:57:34.801Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"joepie91","message":"so code review is not that big of an expense :P","date":"2018-08-04T23:57:52.591Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"joepie91","message":"quarters: oh, and some non-metrics: I pretty much completely ignore stars, download counts, \"who uses this\", and other metrics of popularity; I've not found it to correlate to quality in the slightest","date":"2018-08-04T23:58:37.997Z","type":"message"}

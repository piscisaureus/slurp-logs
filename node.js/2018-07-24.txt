{"nick":"joepie91","message":"[17:32] <joepie91> needcoffee: okay, so the first issue I'm seeing here is that you're making JSON-formatted requests while dealing with binary data; there basically exists no efficient way to encode binary data in JSON, and most of the approaches are very error-prone, so the general advice for that is \"just don't do binary and JSON at the same time\" (most file storage APIs will eg. have you create an item with metadata first and only then upload","date":"2018-07-24T15:43:52.095Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"joepie91","message":"[17:33] <joepie91> relatedly, it's generally not a good idea to store binary data in MongoDB, or any database for that matter; it makes it more difficult to scale your bulk storage and databases tend to not be very efficient at handling binary data","date":"2018-07-24T15:43:56.551Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"joepie91","message":"[17:34] <joepie91> somewhere in this process is probably where your data is getting mangled, because you're dealing with it in a string representation rather than a binary representation","date":"2018-07-24T15:43:58.048Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"joepie91","message":"[17:34] <joepie91> the normal representation of binary data in JS is to use a Buffer (in Node.js) or a typed array of some sort (in browsers) like UInt8Arrays, ArrayBuffers, etc.","date":"2018-07-24T15:43:59.593Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"joepie91","message":"[17:36] <joepie91> needcoffee: btw, this is likely also why it works fine with fs.readFileSync; that produces a Buffer by default","date":"2018-07-24T15:44:07.613Z","type":"message"}

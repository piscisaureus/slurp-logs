{"nick":"nahtnam","message":"Im trying to learn mongodb. I have a question about relations. Lets say i have a users and comments collection. In the comments collection do I just add a `user_id` field or something to relate it to a user, or are you supposed to add a \"comments\" field in the users collection? So like { username: 'test', password: 'hash', comments []}","date":"2018-07-07T22:15:17.716Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"zsoc","message":"mazula_: yeah, just come up with a good way to organize all your 'helper' functions... sometimes calling them 'models' and organizing them by entity is great, sometimes not so much... depends on your app","date":"2018-06-28T15:44:58.746Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"zsoc","message":"ddavvidd: what is #with? (i'm not super familiar with handlebars).. do you want to loop over your categories object here or are you just trying to get at the categories.envelope / categories.host? it's not clear from your template","date":"2018-06-28T15:49:00.987Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"zsoc","message":"mazula_: you could have a function like doesCourseBelongToUser(userId, courseId) or something? so it's reusable in different context and not only this one","date":"2018-06-28T15:50:11.734Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"zsoc","message":"*or*, you could just fetch the course as part of your submitCourse function and check that first (and throw if it doesn't)... and then just change the signature to submitCourse(courseId, userId)","date":"2018-06-28T15:51:14.553Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"zsoc","message":"but that seems less ergonomic... you might want to submit a course from other contexts later on where the userId is irrelevant","date":"2018-06-28T15:51:52.747Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mazula_","message":"zsoc the fist option is good because I have the same logic in many routes (verify that the user is the author of the course)","date":"2018-06-28T15:52:12.827Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ddavvidd","message":"if you look at the html-part, I want category, title and then the category again and the data value and data display.

{"nick":"zsoc","message":"the category name is already in the object (you have { category: 'envelope' } etc) so by doing {envelope: { category: 'envelope', ...} you're creating an extra layer","date":"2018-06-28T15:54:28.050Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"zsoc","message":"just adjust the shape so it ends up like: categories: [{ category: 'envelope', ...}, { category: 'host', ...}, ...]","date":"2018-06-28T15:54:57.134Z","type":"message"}

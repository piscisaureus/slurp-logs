{"nick":"jaawerth","message":"FunnyLookinHat: test how? JS is already very fast. You can get faster writing pure optimized WASM, sure, because you can micro-optimize, but it's going to be messier, and you're likely to run into similar perf limitations for any other language you compile to WASM. You may get some benefits from a strongly typed language but for a high-level lang, JS on node is insanely fast","date":"2018-09-10T15:52:59.315Z","type":"message"}

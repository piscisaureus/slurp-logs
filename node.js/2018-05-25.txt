{"nick":"blastino","message":"Hello. I'm running into a problem with running Mocha tests. I have a big test suite. Every now and then in some of the async beforeAll() hooks I get a network or database error. This causes the entire suite to stop running. If I catch the error in the beforeAll() they will keep running, but I have a lot of these. I'm wondering if there's a catch-all solution for this. Any ideas?","date":"2018-05-25T23:36:54.040Z","type":"message"}

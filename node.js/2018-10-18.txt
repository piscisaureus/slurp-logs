{"nick":"degva","message":"Hi all, I'm running an app on electron (hope is the right place to ask) the thing is that I need to sent (through post method) a file from the filesystem. I've tried creating a File() object, but I've got no luck. I've seen that I should pass a createReadStream() but the problem is that it does contains attributes like the filename. Does anybody has worked with that before? thanks in advance!","date":"2018-10-18T02:36:58.000Z","type":"message"}

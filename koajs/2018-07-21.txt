{"nick":"nok","message":"hey all, beginner question here. So, I wanted to check out Koa and thought this would be a good starting point: https://github.com/dbalas/koalerplate. Now, whenever I edit the code, the server should reload but it seems to throw an error \"Error: listen EADDRINUSE\" but if I save repeatedly ('Ctrl + S' two times), it throws the same error a few times (usually 2) but then starts again. I'm pretty noob so is there a process I need to close or","date":"2018-07-21T06:07:32.220Z","type":"message"}

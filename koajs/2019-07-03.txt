{"nick":"ALowther","message":"Hello, I have some questions. In the source code, there is a function `get length()`, it returns `return ~~len;`. What is the point of this as it just returns the original number. Unless the original type isn't a number, in which case it would be 0...and in the case of it being greater than an unsigned 32 bit integer, the original value will be lost and the returned value unpredictable.","date":"2019-07-03T02:07:54.207Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ALowther","message":"I also am curious in koa-compose, it the `compose` function returns `return function (context, next)`. How are context and next populated with values when this is defined within another function and context and next are not locally defined.","date":"2019-07-03T02:10:54.614Z","type":"message"}
